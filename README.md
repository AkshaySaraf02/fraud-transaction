## Overview
This project aims to build a fraud detection model using a dataset containing transaction records.  The project utilizes exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and detect data quality issues. Feature engineering is performed to select relevant features and preprocess the data for model training. The project evaluates the performance of several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Gradient Boosting. The models are assessed using accuracy as the primary metric.

## Goals
The main goals of this project are:
- Develop a fraud detection model to identify fraudulent transactions accurately.
- Explore and analyze the dataset to gain insights into patterns and characteristics of fraudulent transactions.
- Evaluate the performance of different machine learning algorithms for fraud detection.

## Technical Aspect
The project involves the following technical aspects:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset and detect any data quality issues.
- Feature engineering to select relevant features and preprocess the data for model training.
- Training and evaluation of machine learning models for fraud detection.
- Performance metrics analysis and interpretation.
